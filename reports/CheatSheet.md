# 🚗 CS439 Final Project — Visualization Cheat Sheet  
A quick-reference guide to what each Act and visualization should communicate to your audience.

---

# 🎬 Act 1 – Diverging Priorities  
**Core Message:** Sports cars and everyday EPA vehicles evolve with fundamentally different goals.

## Visualization 1A – Sports Car Trendlines  
- **Shows:** HP ↑, engine sizes stable or ↑, prices ↑↑  
- **User Learns:** Sports cars prioritize *power and luxury*.  
- **Interactions:** Brand filter, toggle metrics, year slider.  
- **Takeaway:** “The sports market pays for speed.”

## Visualization 1B – EPA Vehicle Trendlines  
- **Shows:** MPG ↑, CO₂ ↓, displacement ↓  
- **User Learns:** Efficiency-focused evolution.  
- **Takeaway:** “Everyday vehicles chase practicality and environmental goals.”

## Visualization 1C – Side-by-Side / Gap View  
- **Shows:** Parallel but opposite evolution.  
- **Takeaway:** “Two markets, two missions.”

# ⚡ Act 2 – Electrification (Updated)  
**Core Message:** Electrification fundamentally transforms everyday vehicles — not sports cars.  
**Purpose of this Act:** Highlight a *one-sided convergence* caused by EV adoption.

## Visualization 2A – EPA Fuel Share Over Time  
- **Shows:** Gas ↓, Hybrid/EV ↑↑  
- **User Learns:** EPA vehicles shift rapidly toward electrification.  
- **Takeaway:** “Mainstream vehicles evolve dramatically.”

## Visualization 2B – EPA Performance vs Efficiency Scatter  
- **Shows:** EVs break the trade-off (high performance *and* efficiency).  
- **Takeaway:** “Electrification enables new capabilities.”

## Act 2 Narrative Adjustment  
- **Sports dataset has no EV entries.**  
- This contrast is intentional and meaningful:
  - EPA: rapid electrification  
  - Sports: no electrification  
- **Takeaway:** “Convergence is happening from one side only — EPA vehicles move toward sports performance, but sports cars do not move toward EPA efficiency.”

# 🔮 Act 3 – Convergence or Coexistence?  
**Core Message:** Some convergence appears, but most of the market remains split.

## Visualization 3A – Performance & Efficiency Indices  
- **Shows:** EPA HP ↑, MPG ↑; Sports HP ↑↑, efficiency flat  
- **Takeaway:** “EPA vehicles rise toward performance; sports do not move toward efficiency.”

## Visualization 3B – Market Clustering  
- **Shows:** Three natural clusters  
  - Performance (sports)  
  - Efficiency (EPA gas/EV)  
  - Balanced / bridge (some EVs & hybrids)  
- **Takeaway:** “A small middle cluster emerges — partial convergence.”

## Visualization 3C – Summary Comparison Table  
- **Shows:** 2000–2005 vs 2018–2025 metrics  
- **Takeaway:** “EPA evolves across multiple fronts; sports evolve narrowly.”

# 🌟 Final Story Summary  
- **Act 1:** The two markets begin far apart.  
- **Act 2:** Electrification radically reshapes EPA vehicles, leaving sports cars behind.  
- **Act 3:** This one-sided evolution creates a *bridge segment* but not full convergence.
